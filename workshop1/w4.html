    <blockquote>
      "Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important."

    <blockquote>
Code is a way of conformity so as to maximize efficiency It's a means of sustaining an ecosystem, community, or other such system that relies on multiple individual and at times independent forces. A code can be a set of rules, but more than that it's a way of life. It's a way for someone to live their life by and something that does, in turn, give definition to their lives.

A code is a way of life that's clearly dictated through written document. Although a code can be passed down orally, it's not truly a code until it is transcribed onto something. Otherwise, such a code is too vulnerable to bias in storytelling and the wear of time. Such a "code" can be mistranslated to the point where it no longer is a singular set of rules but multiple variations.

A code is something that goes beyond the function of language in that it CANNOT be mistranslated. It is NOT open to interpretation and is a fact in itself. Codes are, however, communicated through language which does in fact alter the previous two statements. Such is so that a code cannot truly exist throughout time as itself and is always vulnerable to change as time progresses.

An example of a code that has altered throughout time is the bill of rights in the Constitution. The language at the time of writing did not included blacks or women but such code meant something different then.
